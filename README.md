I've been in a Java world for years. Basically after finishing university and switching from beloved, yet platform-bound C#/.NET environment (back in the days when Mono was not really competitive and .NET Core didn't exist) to Java - I became a fan of the Java platform and really liked it. The language was verbose, yet still simple - no pointers, no caring about references or memory management (I got some experience with C++ as well. Let's not talk about this mental breakdown). The ecosystem was huge! Lots of new libraries to choose from, web-oriented JavaEE with the simple and universal Servlet API, JSPs, JSFs and other stuff.

I started experimenting with other JDK languages. Groovy was a great starting point, Clojure opened my mind to functional programming and Kotlin was a well-deserved fresh wind that brought new syntax sugar to the JDK platform.

Later on - I was hardly a programmer - I was just putting blocks of frameworks together and producing universal web applications in a no time. 
And in parallel - the popularity of cloud-native applications risen. Java community started to do a weird things for Javists - compiling native images, getting rid of classic JVM.

And a wild competitor appeared - Go. Also known as "Golang".

What's so great about this new kind on the block? Why its becoming more and more popular.
I decided to figure out - my next project was in Go.

And this is the output of my experience with it. The good, bad and ugly things.

If you are (not limited to) Java developer and want to learn Go or just find out whats the big fuzz about it - read this "book". It might give you some answers.
